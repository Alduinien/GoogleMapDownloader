# GoogleMapDownloader

Created by Adrien de Jaur√©guiberry

A script that builds a high resolution satellite image by downloading tiles from Google Map. It is designed to work with the free version of the API like this:

Give a gps position (lat,long), a map length, an image size and a key.
The script will compute the adapted zoom and the tile size, and download all the tiles with a little more pixels to crop the Google logo. Then it assembles the tiles in one image.

The map will be a square whose center is (lat,long) with an edge of map length (in m) and image size (in pixels).


          map length (m)
        image size (pixels)

The key parameter is not necessary but it might allow you to download much more if you request one on GMap site.

You can run the given example in a python 3 console like this:
```
import GoogleMapDownloader as gmd
gmd.run_example()
```
